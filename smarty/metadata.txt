about=<b>Simple and Accurate Geocoding For Your Maps</b><br><br>Smarty’s QGIS Geocoding plugin allows you to interactively geocode US addresses on your QGIS maps. There are several geocoding plugins in QGIS to choose from, but Smarty's plugin is the easiest to use and the most accurate, with addresses being geocoded down to the rooftop and parcel levels. Subaddress geocodes are also available for secondary addresses such as  apartments and suites.<br><br><b>Address Verification, Standardization, and Autocomplete Included</b><br><br>Simply enter an address and let our plugin validate, standardize, geocode, and plot it on your map. It even uses our US Address Autocomplete product to help you avoid entering errant address information.<br><br><b>Batch Geocoding Available</b><br><br>While a subscription is not required to use the plugin, Smarty customers with a US Rooftop Geocoding subscription have the additional benefit of geocoding large batches of addresses at rates of up to 600-700 records/sec.<br><br><ul><li><a href="https://www.smarty.com/docs/qgis-geocoding-plugin-us-address">Read the documentation for this plugin</a></li><li><a href="https://www.smarty.com/plugins/qgis-geocoding-plugin-us-address">Learn more about Smarty's QGIS Geocoding Plugin - US Address</a></li><li><a href="https://www.smarty.com/products/us-rooftop-geocoding#geocoding-tool">Learn more about Smarty's US Rooftop Geocoding</a></li><li><a href="https://www.smarty.com/">Visit Smarty.com</a></li></ul><br><br><b>Additional Metadata Output</b><br><br>Output fields include parsed, standardized address components, ZIP+4 Code, precision match level, county name, FIPS Code, congressional district, time zone with Daylight Savings Indicator, and whether the address is residential or commercial (RDI).<br><br>
